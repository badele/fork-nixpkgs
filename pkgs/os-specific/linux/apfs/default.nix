      The Apple File System (APFS) is the copy-on-write filesystem currently
      used on all Apple devices. This module provides a degree of experimental
      support on Linux.
      If you make use of the write support, expect data corruption.
      Read-only support is somewhat more complete, with sealed volumes,
      snapshots, and all the missing compression algorithms recently added.
      Encryption is still not in the works though.
